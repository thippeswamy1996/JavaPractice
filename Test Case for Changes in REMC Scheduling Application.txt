### Test Case for Changes in REMC Scheduling Application

#### Test Case 1: PSM File Reading through API

1. **Objective:**
   - To validate the functionality of reading PSM files through the specified API.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Wait for the scheduler to run automatically every one hour.
   b. Manually run the scheduler with a specified date selection.
   c. Check the process log for details of Auto/Manual schedule, user name, file name, approval number, success, warning, error, and timestamp.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. The scheduler runs automatically every one hour.
   b. The scheduler can be manually triggered with a specified date selection.
   c. The process log provides detailed information on Auto/Manual schedules, including success, warning, and error messages.

#### Test Case 2: PSM File Reading through CSV File

1. **Objective:**
   - To validate the functionality of reading PSM files through CSV files.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Manually run the process for reading PSM files.
   b. Upload a PSM file in the standard format.
   c. Check the process log for details of Auto/Manual schedule, user name, file name, approval number, success, warning, error, and timestamp.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. The process can be manually triggered for reading PSM files.
   b. The system allows users to upload PSM files in the standard format.
   c. The process log provides detailed information on Auto/Manual schedules, including success, warning, and error messages.

#### Test Case 3: Logic in Reading LTA, MTOA, GNA, and GNA-RE Contracts (Case-1)

1. **Objective:**
   - To validate the logic for reading LTA, MTOA, GNA, and GNA-RE contracts when PSM File block-wise quantum is less than or equal to the max contract capacity.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Use a sample LTA contract with Approval Number L_ER_2018_04 and Max Contract Capacity of 50 MW.
   b. Ensure that the PSM quantum provided block-wise is less than or equal to the max contract capacity.
   c. Check the success message and approval number in the log.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. The logic successfully uses PSM quantum block-wise to restrict schedules for the specified LTA contract.
   b. The PSM quantum block-wise is less than or equal to the max contract capacity.
   c. A success message is logged along with the correct approval number.

#### Test Case 4: Logic in Reading LTA, MTOA, GNA, and GNA-RE Contracts (Case-2)

1. **Objective:**
   - To validate the logic for reading LTA, MTOA, GNA, and GNA-RE contracts when PSM File block-wise quantum is greater than the max contract capacity.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Use a sample MTOA contract with Approval Number M_SR_2018_05 and Max Contract Capacity of 100 MW.
   b. Ensure that the PSM quantum provided block-wise is greater than the max contract capacity.
   c. Check the success and warning messages in the log.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. The logic successfully uses PSM quantum block-wise to restrict schedules for the specified MTOA contract.
   b. The PSM quantum block-wise is greater than the max contract capacity.
   c. Success and warning messages are logged with the correct approval number.

#### Test Case 5: Schedule Submission - Existing Scheduling Process

1. **Objective:**
   - To validate the existing scheduling process for submitting schedules.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Submit schedules for all contracts that are agreed and given consent.
   b. Verify that schedules submitted before 06:00 hrs of the Day "D" are considered valid.
   c. Attempt to revise schedules for I-GNA and T-GNA RE up to the approved quantum.
   d. Enter correct details for capacity in the 96-time blocks.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. Schedules are successfully submitted for all contracts with agreed consent.
   b. Schedules submitted before 06:00 hrs of the Day "D" are considered valid.
   c. I-GNA and T-GNA RE schedules can be revised up to the approved quantum.
   d. Correct details for capacity in the 96-time blocks are accepted.

#### Test Case 6: Schedule Submission - Hybrid Plants

1. **Objective:**
   - To validate the schedule submission process for hybrid plants.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Punch schedules and AvC for separate hybrid stations.
   b. Ensure that combined (Solar and wind) hybrid components do not exceed the set limit.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. Separate hybrid stations can punch schedules and AvC up to their installed capacity.
   b. Combined (Solar and wind) hybrid components do not exceed the set limit.
