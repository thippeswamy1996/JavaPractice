6.2.6 Performance Testing
Verify that the system throughput, timing and response time requirements are satisfied. Tests shall
include verification of:
➢ Data exchange times
➢ Local and remote request response times
➢ Communication latency
➢ User Interface function response time
//////////////////////////
6.2.7 Security Testing
Verify that the system meets the software at delivery security requirements and other aspects of
secure operation and system access including:
➢ Communication error detection capabilities
Correct operation of system configuration, control, maintenance, and management
procedures Safe system recovery with no erroneous data or control operation
generation after system restarts.
➢ Protection against unauthorized access to the system and control functions
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
6.2.8 Environmental Testing
Verify that:-
➢ All system functions shall operate correctly over the specified temperature range.
➢ The accuracy of the inputs and outputs remain valid over the specified temperature
range.
The test schedule shall allow sufficient time for verification and/or additional unstructured testing
by the SLDC/HVPNL's representative, who shall be able to schedule unstructured testing at any
time, including during structured tests.
/////////////////////////////////////////////
6.3 Site Acceptance Test (SAT)
The SAT will be conducted by the OWNER (Respective CO&C Divisions and End Users etc.)
with support, as required from the vendor, after the system has been installed and commissioned.
The system will be subjected to a subset of the functional and performance tests. The SAT will
also include any type of testing that could not be performed in the factory. HVPNL/SLDC’s
representative, as necessary, will employ unstructured tests to verify overall system operation
under field conditions. Any defects or design errors discovered during the SAT shall be corrected
by the Vendor. The SAT includes the commissioning test, the functional and performance test, and
the cyber security audit after the installation of the delivered system.
/////////////////////////////////
6.3.1 Commissioning Test
• The commissioning tests shall be conducted by the vendor and include:
• The same visual inspection and verification as in FAT
• Loading of the software and starting the system. At the option of the HVPNL/SLDC, all
software shall be recompiled from the source or distribution media.
• Interface of the AMR and MDP System to communications facilities for all data sources
and other systems that interface with the AMR System.
• Initialization and preliminary tuning of application software as needed.////////////////
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
6.3.2 Site Functional and Performance Test
The site functional and performance test (“site test”) shall be comprised of a subset of the
functional and performance tests conducted in FAT. The tests to be performed shall be proposed
by the Contractor and approved by HVPNL/SLDC. These tests shall be extended as necessary to test functions simulated during the FAT, such as communications with all field devices and all
other systems that interface with the CDC
///////////////////////////
6.3.3 Site Cyber Security Audit
The site cyber security audit shall repeat the audit performed during factory testing
/////////////////////////////////////
6.4 Test Approval
The Vendor shall maintain a complete computer record of all test results with variance reporting
and processing procedures for approval by HVPNL/SLDC. In the event that the AMR/Complete
Software System including MDP system does not successfully pass any portion of the Acceptance
Testing, the Vendor shall notify the HVPNL/ SLDC of the specific deficiency. The Vendor shall
promptly correct the specified deficiency, which will then be re-tested until successful.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Comprehensive training programs shall be provided to enable the efficient and effective use and
operation of the deployed system by users of the system, and to develop a self - sufficient hardware
and software support team within HVPNL, SLDC and the registered users of HVPNL/SLDC.
The bidder shall prepare and provide a description of the proposed training programs with course
content, and technical level of the instruction for review and approval by the HVPNL/SLDC at the
beginning of the deployment, and shall work with the SLDC to schedule, organize and execute the
approved training programs.
Training shall include, where appropriate, a combination of formal training classes, workshops, as
well as continuous (informal) knowledge transfer from the Vendor’s technical specialists to the
personnel of SLDC and its constituents during the deployment process and after the
commissioning of the AMR and Complete Software system including MDP. In-person training
sessions could be offered at Vendor’s location or at the HVPNL/SLDC own facilities or any other
locations of choice by both parties.
Two hard copies and one soft copy of operating manual of the meter and DCU/AMR/MDP
containing all details shall be made available to HVPNL and SLDC each.
