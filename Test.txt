Steps written:

FICTITIOUS TABLE : 

SELECT FICTITIOUS_ID FROM `RSM_FICTITIOUS_METER_REGISTRATION` WHERE DELETE_STATUS=0
Find active Fictitious meter id

SELECT * FROM `RSM_FICTITIOUS_METER_FORMULA` WHERE FICTITIOUS_ID IN (SELECT FICTITIOUS_ID FROM `RSM_FICTITIOUS_METER_REGISTRATION` WHERE DELETE_STATUS=0 ) AND DELETE_STATUS=0
From fictitious will get meter ID’s 

SELECT * FROM 01_00_63_01_00_FF_PROCESSED WHERE 00_00_01_00_00_FF >= '2024-01-20 00:00:00' AND 00_00_01_00_00_FF < '2024-01-21 00:00:00' AND DELETE_STATUS=0 AND METER_ID IN (SELECT METER_ID FROM `RSM_FICTITIOUS_METER_FORMULA` WHERE DELETE_STATUS=0 AND `FICTITIOUS_ID` IN (SELECT FICTITIOUS_ID FROM `RSM_FICTITIOUS_METER_REGISTRATION` WHERE DELETE_STATUS=0) ) GROUP BY METER_ID,00_00_01_00_00_FF

In formula table search Active Fictitious id and respective active meter id consider.

formula table to Proceed 

In formula table based on column operation multiply value in proceed table’s same column and note down for each meter id

For eg : for 1 Fictitious Id 3 Meter id’s are available then check 3 operations and note down separately.

Once we calculated then sum of all meter id’s.

Meter Registration to  Fictitious table.
RSM_FICTITIOUS_METER_REGISTRATION table search fictitious id 
Check the column operations (eg. MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM) Which is mentioned take and compare with all calculated meter id for same fictitious id.
Output check in Fictitious table
