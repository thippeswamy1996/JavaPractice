### Test Case: Approval Number and Max Contract Capacity Consistency

**Objective:**
To ensure that the Approval Number and Max Contract Capacity for any particular contract are consistent and unique across the PSM file, WBES, and REMC Database.

**Preconditions:**
1. PSM files, WBES, and REMC Database are accessible and configured for the test.
2. Contracts with various Approval Numbers and Max Contract Capacities exist in the PSM file, WBES, and REMC Database.

**Steps:**

1. **Verify Consistency in PSM File:**
   a. Open the PSM file containing various contracts.
   b. For each contract, check that the Approval Number and Max Contract Capacity are specified.
   c. Ensure that there are no missing or inconsistent entries for Approval Number or Max Contract Capacity.
   d. Confirm that the Approval Numbers are unique for each contract.

2. **Verify Consistency with WBES:**
   a. Access the WBES system.
   b. Retrieve the contracts' details that correspond to the ones in the PSM file.
   c. Check that the Approval Numbers and Max Contract Capacities match those in the PSM file.
   d. Ensure that there are no missing or inconsistent entries.

3. **Verify Consistency with REMC Database:**
   a. Access the REMC Database.
   b. Retrieve the contracts' details that correspond to the ones in the PSM file.
   c. Check that the Approval Numbers and Max Contract Capacities match those in the PSM file.
   d. Ensure that there are no missing or inconsistent entries.

4. **Unique Approval Numbers:**
   a. Check that each Approval Number in the PSM file is unique.
   b. Verify that each Approval Number in WBES is unique.
   c. Confirm that each Approval Number in the REMC Database is unique.

**Expected Results:**
1. The Approval Numbers and Max Contract Capacities in the PSM file are consistent and free of missing entries.
2. The Approval Numbers and Max Contract Capacities in WBES match those in the PSM file.
3. The Approval Numbers and Max Contract Capacities in the REMC Database match those in the PSM file.
4. Each Approval Number is unique within the PSM file, WBES, and the REMC Database.

**Note:**
If any inconsistencies or issues are found during the verification steps, the test case should be considered failed, and further investigation and resolution are required.
