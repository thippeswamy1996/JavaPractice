### Test Case for Payment Security Mechanism (PSM)

#### Test Case 1: Pre-Conditions for CSV File

1. **Objective:**
   - To validate the pre-conditions for the CSV file related to Payment Security Mechanism (PSM).

2. **Steps:**
   a. Attempt to upload a file in a format other than .CSV.
   b. Upload PSM files for past days, current day, and next day with a change in revision number.
   c. Attempt to upload PSM files for contracts other than LT A, MTOA, GNA, and T-GNA.
   d. Upload a file with a PSM restriction limit in MW at EX-Bus seller for GNA & T-GNA contracts.
   e. Verify that the file contains the required information horizontally in the specified standard format.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. The system rejects files that are not in .CSV format.
   b. PSM files for past days, current day, and next day are successfully uploaded with revision number changes.
   c. PSM files are not applicable for STOA, IEX, PXI, RTM-IEX, and RTM-PXI contracts.
   d. PSM restriction limit is specified in MW at EX-Bus seller for GNA & T-GNA contracts.
   e. The uploaded file adheres to the specified standard format.

#### Test Case 2: Pre-Conditions for API

1. **Objective:**
   - To validate the pre-conditions for the API related to Payment Security Mechanism (PSM).

2. **Steps:**
   a. Confirm that the API is provided by NRLDC in a standard format.
   b. Ensure there is provision for reading PSM file date-wise in the API.
   c. Confirm that the API requires a JSON format for standard files.
   d. Verify the presence of a flag for identifying the revision in the API.
   e. Ensure that PSM files can be revised for past days, current day, and next day with a change in revision number.
   f. Confirm auto-scheduling for fetching current day and next day PSM data from the API.
   g. Confirm that manual options are available for fetching past date (ex-post facto) PSM data.
   h. Confirm that PSM is applicable only for GNA & T-GNA contracts, not for STOA, IEX, PXI, RTM-IEX, and RTM-PXI contracts.
   i. Confirm that the PSM restriction limit should be in MW at EX-Bus seller for GNA & T-GNA contracts in the API.
   j. Verify that the API contains the required information: Generator name, Buyer name, contract type, Approval number, PSM restriction limit in MW block-wise for 96 blocks.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. The API is provided by NRLDC in the specified standard format.
   b. The API allows reading PSM file date-wise.
   c. The API requires a JSON format for standard files.
   d. The API includes a flag for identifying the revision.
   e. PSM files can be revised with a change in revision number for past days, current day, and next day.
   f. Auto-scheduling is enabled for fetching current day and next day PSM data.
   g. Manual options are available for fetching past date (ex-post facto) PSM data.
   h. PSM is applicable only for GNA & T-GNA contracts.
   i. PSM restriction limit is specified in MW at EX-Bus seller for GNA & T-GNA contracts.
   j. The API adheres to the specified standard format.

#### Test Case 3: Approval Number and Contract Capacity Consistency

1. **Objective:**
   - To ensure consistency in Approval Number and Max Contract Capacity for any particular contract in the PSM file, WBES, and REMC Database.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Verify that Approval Number and Max Contract Capacity are the same for a particular contract in the PSM file.
   b. Check that Approval Number and Max Contract Capacity are consistent between WBES and the REMC Database.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. Approval Number and Max Contract Capacity for a particular contract are consistent in the PSM file.
   b. Approval Number and Max Contract Capacity for a particular contract are consistent between WBES and the REMC Database.

#### Test Case 4: Unique Approval Number

1. **Objective:**
   - To ensure that Approval Numbers are unique, and no two contracts (renewable and non-renewable) have the same Approval Number.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Attempt to upload PSM files with duplicate Approval Numbers for different contracts.
   b. Verify that no two contracts (renewable and non-renewable) have the same Approval Number.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. The system rejects PSM files with duplicate Approval Numbers for different contracts.
   b. No two contracts (
   
   
   NOTE:PSM is applicable only for GNA & T-GNA contracts. 
PSM will not be applicable for STOA ,
IEX,PXl,RTM-IEX and RTM-PXI contracts.
