It looks like you're very close to getting your code to work correctly. There are just a few small issues to correct:

1. **Typo in Method Name:** The method `chatAt(i)` should be `charAt(i)`. 

2. **Incorrect Use of Semicolon:** The semicolon after the `if` condition ends the `if` statement prematurely, meaning the `count++` will execute on every iteration of the loop regardless of whether the condition is true or not.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of your code:

```java
public class DSA {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 1;
        int b = 2;
        int c = a + b;
        System.out.println(c);

        String d = "thippesj";
        int count = 0;

        // Loop through each character in the string
        for (int i = 0; i < d.length(); i++) {
            // Check if the character at the current position is a space
            if (d.charAt(i) == ' ') {
                count++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```

### Summary of Changes:
1. Changed `d.chatAt(i)` to `d.charAt(i)`.
2. Removed the semicolon after `if (d.charAt(i) == ' ')`.

### Explanation:
- **`charAt(i)`**: This method retrieves the character at index `i` in the string.
- **`if (d.charAt(i) == ' ')`**: This checks if the character at index `i` is a space.
- **`count++`**: This increments the count only when the condition is true (i.e., when the character is a space).

With these fixes, your code will correctly count the number of spaces in the string `d` and print that count. Since `"thippesj"` contains no spaces, the output for `count` will be `0`.
