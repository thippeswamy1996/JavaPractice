### Test Case for Schedule Generation and Implementation

#### Test Case: Schedule Generation and Implementation

1. **Objective:**
   - To verify that the schedule generation and implementation process considers submitted schedules, Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) data, grid management restrictions, and buyer requisition from WBES.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Submit schedules by the scheduling entity.
   b. Optionally, if any schedules are submitted by RLDC, take note of them.
   c. Ensure PSM data is available for the relevant contracts.
   d. Consider grid management restrictions.
   e. Fetch buyer requisition from WBES for any particular revision.
   f. Initiate the schedule generation process.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. Schedules are successfully submitted by the scheduling entity.
   b. Optionally, RLDC-submitted schedules are considered.
   c. PSM data is available and considered for relevant contracts.
   d. Grid management restrictions are taken into account.
   e. Buyer requisition from WBES is successfully fetched for any particular revision.
   f. The schedule generation process is initiated without errors.

#### Test Case: Schedule Consideration Logic

1. **Objective:**
   - To verify that the schedule generation logic considers the minimum of submitted schedules, PSM data, and grid management restrictions.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Submit a schedule for a contract.
   b. Enter PSM data for the same contract.
   c. Set grid management restrictions for the contract.
   d. Initiate the schedule generation process.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. The submitted schedule for the contract is successfully stored.
   b. PSM data for the contract is successfully entered.
   c. Grid management restrictions for the contract are successfully set.
   d. The schedule generation process considers the minimum of the submitted schedule, PSM data, and grid management restrictions.

#### Test Case: Final Schedule Implementation

1. **Objective:**
   - To verify that the final schedule implementation process generates the consolidated schedule, taking all ex-post facto revisions into account.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Initiate the final schedule implementation process.
   b. Ensure all ex-post facto revisions are considered.
   c. Review the final consolidated schedule.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. The final schedule implementation process is initiated successfully.
   b. All ex-post facto revisions are taken into account during the consolidation process.
   c. The final consolidated schedule is generated without errors.
