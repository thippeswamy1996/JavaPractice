Here are some detailed test cases for the Meter Data Management (MDM) software based on the requirements provided:

### Test Case 1: Meter Data Validation in MDAS
**Objective:** Verify that the meter data is correctly validated in the Meter Data Acquisition System (MDAS) for further processing.

**Steps:**
1. Input valid meter data into the MDAS.
2. Submit the data for validation.
3. Check the system response for successful validation.

**Expected Result:**
- The system should validate the meter data without errors and indicate successful validation.

**Test Case 2: Configuration of ABT Meter Details**
**Objective:** Ensure the software correctly configures ABT meter details and computes the Multiplying Factor (MF) accurately.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the ABT meter configuration interface.
2. Enter the following details:
   - Location of installation
   - Entity & sub-entity name
   - Meter ID
   - Meter Serial Number
   - Accuracy Class
   - CT/PT ratios
3. Save the configuration.
4. Verify that the MF is computed and stored in the database.

**Expected Result:**
- The details should be saved successfully.
- The MF should be computed based on the entered data and stored correctly in the database.

**Test Case 3: Manual Entry of Total Energy Data**
**Objective:** Verify that the software allows manual entry of total energy data with the appropriate approval workflow.

**Steps:**
1. Access the manual entry interface for total energy data.
2. Enter the total energy data for a specific meter.
3. Submit the data for approval.
4. Follow the approval workflow as per configuration.
5. Verify the data entry and approval status.

**Expected Result:**
- The manual entry should be accepted and the data should be stored only after successful approval.

**Test Case 4: Entity-Wise Meter Data Processing**
**Objective:** Ensure the software processes meter data and develops entity-wise meter data information correctly.

**Steps:**
1. Input meter data into the MDAS.
2. Initiate the processing of meter data.
3. Verify that the entity-wise meter data information is generated correctly.

**Expected Result:**
- The software should process the data and produce accurate entity-wise meter data information.

**Test Case 5: Configuration/Linking of ABT Meters with Polarity**
**Objective:** Confirm that the software allows configuration/linking of ABT meters with polarity and categorizes meters correctly.

**Steps:**
1. Access the meter configuration/linking interface.
2. Configure/link meters to entities with their respective polarity.
3. Categorize meters as Main, Check, or Standby.
4. Save the configurations.

**Expected Result:**
- Meters should be correctly linked with their polarity and categorized appropriately for energy computation.

**Test Case 6: Automatic Computation of 15-Minute Block Values**
**Objective:** Verify that the software automatically computes 15-minute block (including 5 minutes in the future) active export, import, and reactive energy values.

**Steps:**
1. Input meter data with active export, import, and reactive energy values.
2. Check the computation for 15-minute blocks, including the 5-minute future values.
3. Validate the computed values for accuracy.

**Expected Result:**
- The software should correctly compute and display 15-minute block values, including future blocks.

**Test Case 7: Reading and Updating 15-Minute Block Data**
**Objective:** Ensure that the software can read and update 15-minute block data values and reactive high/low midnight values according to the user-defined period.

**Steps:**
1. Set a period for updating 15-minute block data.
2. Read and verify active export, import, and reactive high/low midnight values.
3. Update the database with the new values.

**Expected Result:**
- The software should accurately read, update, and store the 15-minute block and reactive midnight values as per the defined period.

**Test Case 8: ABT Meter Data Validation, Estimation, and Assessment**
**Objective:** Verify that the software performs validation, estimation, and assessment of ABT meter data correctly.

**Steps:**
1. Input ABT meter data into the system.
2. Run the validation, estimation, and assessment processes.
3. Review the results of these processes.

**Expected Result:**
- The software should perform all the specified processes (validation, estimation, and assessment) and provide accurate results.

These test cases cover the core functionalities and ensure that the Meter Data Management software meets the specified requirements.
