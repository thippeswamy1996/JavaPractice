Your list of security test cases covers many important areas, but there are a few additional scenarios and considerations you might want to include to ensure comprehensive security testing:

### Additional Security Test Cases

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing**
   - **Test Goal:** To verify that the application is protected against XSS attacks.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - **Precondition:** Application should be accessible.
     - **Actions:** Attempt to inject malicious scripts (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) into input fields, URLs, and parameters.
     - **Expected Result:** The application should properly sanitize or escape the input and not execute any scripts.

2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Testing**
   - **Test Goal:** To ensure the application is protected against CSRF attacks.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - **Precondition:** Application should be accessible and logged in.
     - **Actions:** Attempt to perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent (e.g., submit a form from an external site).
     - **Expected Result:** The application should validate requests and reject unauthorized CSRF attempts.

3. **SQL Injection Testing**
   - **Test Goal:** To verify that the application is protected against SQL injection attacks.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - **Precondition:** Application should be accessible.
     - **Actions:** Attempt to inject SQL queries (e.g., `' OR '1'='1`) into input fields and URL parameters.
     - **Expected Result:** The application should properly handle and sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection.

4. **Security Misconfiguration Testing**
   - **Test Goal:** To identify and verify that security configurations are properly set.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - **Precondition:** Application should be accessible.
     - **Actions:** Check for default credentials, unnecessary services, and default settings that might be insecure.
     - **Expected Result:** The application should not expose any default or insecure configurations.

5. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
   - **Test Goal:** To verify that direct object references are secured and unauthorized access is prevented.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - **Precondition:** Application should be accessible and logged in.
     - **Actions:** Attempt to access resources by modifying object identifiers in URLs or request parameters.
     - **Expected Result:** Access to resources should be restricted based on user permissions.

6. **Session Fixation Testing**
   - **Test Goal:** To ensure that the application does not accept an existing session ID from an attacker.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - **Precondition:** Application should be accessible and logged in.
     - **Actions:** Attempt to use a fixed session ID to authenticate or access the application.
     - **Expected Result:** The application should generate a new session ID upon login and not accept old ones.

7. **Password Complexity and Security Testing**
   - **Test Goal:** To verify that password policies are enforced correctly.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - **Precondition:** Application should be accessible and allow password changes.
     - **Actions:** Attempt to set passwords that do not meet complexity requirements (e.g., too short, lacks special characters).
     - **Expected Result:** The application should enforce and validate password complexity requirements.

8. **Error Handling and Information Disclosure**
   - **Test Goal:** To ensure that error messages do not reveal sensitive information.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - **Precondition:** Application should be accessible.
     - **Actions:** Trigger errors in the application and observe the error messages.
     - **Expected Result:** Error messages should be generic and not disclose sensitive information (e.g., stack traces, database details).

9. **API Security Testing**
   - **Test Goal:** To test the security of the applicationâ€™s API endpoints.
   - **Test Steps:**
     - **Precondition:** Application API endpoints should be accessible.
     - **Actions:** Test API endpoints for authentication, authorization, and data validation issues.
     - **Expected Result:** API endpoints should be secure and handle authentication and authorization properly.

10. **File Upload and Download Security**
    - **Test Goal:** To ensure secure handling of file uploads and downloads.
    - **Test Steps:**
      - **Precondition:** Application should allow file uploads and downloads.
      - **Actions:** Test for file upload vulnerabilities (e.g., uploading executable files) and ensure proper validation and sanitization.
      - **Expected Result:** The application should handle file uploads and downloads securely, validating file types and sizes.

### Summary

Including these additional test cases will help in covering more potential vulnerabilities and security issues that may arise in your application. Security testing is a continuously evolving field, so staying updated with the latest security practices and threats is crucial for maintaining robust security.
