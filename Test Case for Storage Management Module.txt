### Test Case for Storage Management Module

#### Test Case: Storage Management Data Fetching and Configuration

1. **Objective:**
   - To verify that the Storage Management Module correctly fetches data from WBES and allows the configuration of hydro and battery obligation limits.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Log in to the REMC system as an authorized user.
   b. Navigate to the Storage Management Module.
   c. Verify that the data (Approval number, Obligation limit, From and To Timeblock, Limit Type) is successfully fetched from WBES.
   d. Configure a new hydro obligation limit using the web form.
   e. Configure a new battery obligation limit using the web form.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. The user is successfully logged in.
   b. The Storage Management Module is accessible.
   c. Data is successfully fetched from WBES.
   d. A new hydro obligation limit is successfully configured.
   e. A new battery obligation limit is successfully configured.

4. **Test Case: Special Case Handling for Buyer Requisition Changes**

   - **Objective:**
      - To verify that the system handles special cases where the buyer can change the requisition in WBES during obligated time blocks.

   - **Steps:**
      a. Initiate a change in the buyer requisition in WBES for obligated time blocks.
      b. Verify that the Storage Management Module accommodates the changes.
      c. Check if the new buyer requisition changes are reflected in the system.

   - **Expected Result:**
      a. A change is successfully initiated in the buyer requisition in WBES.
      b. The Storage Management Module accommodates the changes.
      c. The new buyer requisition changes are reflected in the system.

5. **Test Case: Validation of Timeblock Configuration**

   - **Objective:**
      - To ensure that the system validates the configuration of hydro and battery obligation limits for the specified time blocks.

   - **Steps:**
      a. Attempt to configure an obligation limit with an invalid time block.
      b. Verify that the system rejects the configuration and provides appropriate error messaging.
      c. Configure an obligation limit with a valid time block.

   - **Expected Result:**
      a. The system prevents the configuration of an obligation limit with an invalid time block.
      b. The system provides appropriate error messaging.
      c. An obligation limit is successfully configured with a valid time block.

6. **Test Case: Integration with Existing Configuration**

   - **Objective:**
      - To ensure seamless integration of the new changes with the existing configuration process.

   - **Steps:**
      a. Verify that the new changes in the Storage Management Module do not impact existing configurations.
      b. Confirm that hydro and battery obligation limits configured using the web form align with existing configurations.

   - **Expected Result:**
      a. The new changes do not impact existing configurations.
      b. Hydro and battery obligation limits configured using the web form align with existing configurations.
