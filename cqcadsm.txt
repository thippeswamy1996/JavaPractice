### Functional Test Case for Deviation Charge Calculation

**Test Case ID:** TC_DEVIATION_001  
**Description:** Verify the calculation of deviation charges based on absolute error percentage in a 15-minute time block.

**Preconditions:**  
- Solar generation or Wind-Solar Hybrid generation data is available for a specific time block.

**Test Steps:**

1. **Input Scenario 1:** Set absolute error to 8%.  
   **Expected Result:** Deviation charge should be "None".

2. **Input Scenario 2:** Set absolute error to 11%.  
   **Expected Result:** Deviation charge should be calculated as Rs. 0.25 per unit for the excess of 1% (11% - 10%).

3. **Input Scenario 3:** Set absolute error to 12%.  
   **Expected Result:** Deviation charge should be calculated as Rs. 0.25 per unit for the excess of 2% (12% - 10%).

4. **Input Scenario 4:** Set absolute error to 15%.  
   **Expected Result:** Deviation charge should be "None" since it exceeds 12%.

**Postconditions:**  
- Ensure that the system accurately reflects the deviation charges based on the specified rules.

**Notes:**  
- Ensure edge cases (10% and 12%) are tested for accurate boundary behavior.
