6 Forecasting
6.1 KSEBL requires daily, blockâ€”wise demand forecast for forecast horizons of five minutes to
month ahead,and one year to five years ahead. Forecasts shall be updated continually to
support scheduling and dispatching of generation on a 24/7 basis. To achieve the highest accuracy levels, models shall be tailored to account for the unique characteristics of each load,
and also weather data from multiple sources shall be employed appropriately. The model
shall be got approved by the KSEBL to ensure that all the parameters are taken care of be -
fore designing the logic, which are specific for KSEBL, like deterministic Thermal, Hydro and
Inflow forecast, pattern based RE, and daily weather forecast.
Based on our needs, the Software shall be capable to provide forecasts for the entire State
and for subregions (upto 4 subregions) as desired by KSEBL, when the past data for 5
years is furnished for training. System shall be capable of training withRegional load details
at 1min interval upto 25 regions, for improving accuracy. The software shall be capable to
capture and accommodate multiple data inputs like, internal embedded Solar generation
data, effect of Renewable and EV (Electric Vehicle),and geospatial data. KSEBL will provide
regional load details, geospatial data for embedded renewable generation, at I minute
intervals.
