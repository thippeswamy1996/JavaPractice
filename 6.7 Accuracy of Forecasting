6.7 Accuracy of Forecasting:
Accuracy is the essence of any forecasting exercise. In case of this assignment, the
Deviation/error shall be defined as the difference of the forecasted value with the actual
value. Deviation shall be measured with the actual SCADA/AMR data available with SLDC.
Accordingly, KSEBL drawal/Generation data or any other data related to forecasting
considered by KSEBL shall be binding on the Contractor for the SLA (Service Level
Agreement)
1 Short term forecast
i) RTM Forecast
RTM forecastprovided 2 hours ahead shall have an accuracy of 99.5% .
Revisions shall be allowed for RTMfor the remaining hours of the day. At 21 hrs of the
day, RTM forecast for the nextday also to be made available.
ii) Day ahead forecast
Accuracy over a Day (15 minutes timeblock) Mwh–
State Periphery -Error shall be less than 2%.
Intrastate Periphery - Error shall be less than 1.25%.
Current Demand forecast- average for 15 minutes timeblock need to be programmable
to 5 minutes timeblock. Tilltraining data is available, 5 minutes historical data to be
taken by intrapolation.
Accuracy per block MW–
State Periphery -shall be less than 2%
Intrastate Periphery -shall be less than 1.25%.
(Above accuracy shall be maintained for 92 out of 96 (15 min) blocks /276 out of 288

3 Price Forecast
Same day forecast (Real Time) – Blockwise….
Accuracy over a Day–Error shall be less than 2%.
Accuracy per hour –Error shall be less than 2%
( Target 90% of blocks in a day must be maintained with permissible error less than 2%)
 Blocks during Load shedding/ restriction may not to be considered for accuracy level.
 For security reason, past data of each 15 min time block shall be disabled to avoid
malfunctioning in Real time forecasting.
