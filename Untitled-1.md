This Java program is designed to find a unique number in an array of integers where every number except one appears exactly twice. The class `SingleNumber` contains a method `SingleElement` that performs this task. Letâ€™s break down the code and explain its functionality:

```java
package com.exercise;

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class SingleNumber {

    public int SingleElement(int [] nums) {
    
        // Check if the array has only one element
        if (nums.length == 1) return nums[0];
        
        // Create a HashSet to keep track of numbers
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Iterate through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {  // Note: Corrected loop condition from i <= nums.length to i < nums.length
            // If the number is already in the set, remove it (because it has appeared twice)
            if (set.contains(nums[i])) {
                set.remove(nums[i]);
            } else {
                // If the number is not in the set, add it
                set.add(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        
        // At the end of the loop, the set will contain only the unique number
        return set.iterator().next();  // Retrieve and return the single unique number
    }
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Package Declaration and Imports**:
   - `package com.exercise;` defines the package in which the `SingleNumber` class resides.
   - `import java.util.HashSet;` and `import java.util.Set;` import necessary classes from the Java Collections Framework.

2. **Class Definition**:
   - `public class SingleNumber` defines the class `SingleNumber`.

3. **Method Definition**:
   - `public int SingleElement(int [] nums)` is a method that takes an array of integers `nums` as input and returns an integer.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - `if (nums.length == 1) return nums[0];` checks if the array has only one element. If true, it returns that element directly as it is the unique number.

5. **HashSet for Tracking**:
   - `Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();` initializes a `HashSet` to keep track of numbers. A `HashSet` is used because it allows for constant-time complexity for add, remove, and check operations.

6. **Loop Through the Array**:
   - `for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)` iterates through each element of the `nums` array (Note: There was an off-by-one error in the original code where the loop condition was `i <= nums.length`, which should be corrected to `i < nums.length`).

7. **Add or Remove from Set**:
   - Inside the loop, `if (set.contains(nums[i]))` checks if the number is already in the set:
     - If true, `set.remove(nums[i]);` removes it from the set because it has appeared twice.
     - If false, `set.add(nums[i]);` adds the number to the set because it has not been encountered before.

8. **Retrieve Unique Number**:
   - `return set.iterator().next();` retrieves and returns the only element left in the set after processing all elements of the array. Since the set only contains the unique number, this will be the answer.

### Summary
This program efficiently identifies the unique number in an array where every number except one appears twice, using a `HashSet` to keep track of numbers and leveraging its properties for quick lookups and removals. Note that the loop condition was corrected from `i <= nums.length` to `i < nums.length` to avoid `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
