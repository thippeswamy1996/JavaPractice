logout from application-> click on browser back button-> check it is going back to the application.
Check url encryption.
Check password encryption.
 Try to directly access bookmarked web page without login to the system.
2. Verify that system should restrict you to download the file without sign in on the system.
3. Verify that previous accessed pages should not accessible after log out i.e. Sign out and then press the Back button to access the page accessed before.
4. Check the valid and invalid passwords, password rules say cannot be less than 6 characters, user id and password cannot be the same etc.
5. Verified that important i.e. sensitive information such as passwords, ID numbers, credit card numbers, etc should not get displayed in the input box when typing. They should be encrypted and in asterix format.
6 .Check Is bookmarking disabled on secure pages? Bookmarking Should be disabled on secure pages.
7. Check Is Right Click, View, Source disabled? Source code should not be visible to user.
8. Is there an alternative way to access secure pages for browsers under version 3.0, since SSL is not compatible with those browsers?
heck does your server lock out an individual who has tried to access your site multiple times with invalid login/password information?
10. Verify the timeout condition, after timeout user should not able to navigate through the site.-done.
11. Check Are you prevented from doing direct searches by editing content in the URL?
Verify that relevant information should be written to the log files and that information should be traceable.
13. In SSL verify that the encryption is done correctly and check the integrity of the information.
14. Verify that restricted page should not be accessible by user after session time out.-Done.
15. ID / password authentication, the same account on different machines cannot log on at the same time. So at a time only one user can login to the system with a user id.
16. ID / password authentication methods entered the wrong password several times and check if the account gets locked.
17. Add or modify important information (passwords, ID numbers, credit card number, etc.). Check if it gets reflected immediately or caching the old values.
18. Verify that Error Message does not contain malicious info so that hacker will use this information to hack web site.

To verify that the user can access the application after entering too many incorrect credentials.
Verify the effectiveness of network-level security measures.

To verify password encryption, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Password Storage:**
   - Gain access to the system's password storage mechanism. This may involve reviewing the database, configuration files, or authentication modules where passwords are stored.

2. **Check Encryption Algorithm:**
   - Identify the encryption algorithm used for password storage. Ensure that a secure, one-way cryptographic hash function is employed (e.g., bcrypt, SHA-256, Argon2).

3. **Salt Usage:**
   - Verify that a unique salt is applied to each password before hashing. Salt adds randomness to the password hashing process, making it more resistant to attacks like rainbow table attacks.

4. **Examine Hashed Passwords:**
   - Review the hashed passwords stored in the system. Confirm that passwords are not stored in plain text and that the stored values are the result of the chosen encryption algorithm.

5. **Security Auditing Tools:**
   - Use security auditing tools or password cracking tools to attempt to identify weaknesses in the password encryption. This should be done in a controlled environment and with proper authorization.

6. **Check for Plain Text Storage:**
   - Confirm that passwords are not stored in plain text anywhere in the system. This includes logs, configuration files, or any other storage location.

7. **Password Recovery Mechanism:**
   - If applicable, test the password recovery or reset mechanism to ensure it does not expose passwords in plain text during the recovery process.

8. **Review Authentication Process:**
   - Verify that during the authentication process, the entered password is hashed using the same algorithm and compared against the stored hash.

9. **Compare with Best Practices:**
   - Compare the password encryption practices with industry best practices and standards. Ensure compliance with security guidelines and frameworks.

10. **Conduct Regular Audits:**
    - Schedule regular security audits to review and verify the effectiveness of the password encryption mechanisms. This ensures ongoing security and helps identify and address any emerging vulnerabilities.

11. **Collaborate with Security Experts:**
    - Engage with security experts or penetration testers to conduct thorough security assessments, including evaluating the strength of password encryption.

Always perform such verifications responsibly, with proper authorization, and in alignment with relevant security and privacy policies. The goal is to ensure that passwords are stored securely and that the encryption methods employed provide a strong defense against unauthorized access.
