### Test Case for Grid Management Module

#### Test Case: Grid Management Data Fetching and Curtailment/Restoration in REMC

1. **Objective:**
   - To verify that the Grid Management Module functions correctly by fetching data from WBES via API, and allows curtailment and restoration in the REMC tool.

2. **Steps:**
   a. Log in to the REMC system as an authorized user.
   b. Navigate to the Grid Management Module.
   c. Verify that the latest grid management data is fetched from WBES via API.
   d. Check if there is provision for raising curtailment and restoration in the REMC tool.
   e. Raise curtailment for a specific contract and verify that it is reflected in the system.
   f. Raise restoration for the same contract and verify that it is reflected in the system.

3. **Expected Result:**
   a. The user is successfully logged in.
   b. The Grid Management Module is accessible.
   c. The latest grid management data is successfully fetched from WBES via API.
   d. Provision for raising curtailment and restoration exists.
   e. Curtailment is successfully raised for the specified contract.
   f. Restoration is successfully raised for the same contract.

4. **Test Case: Schedule Generation Using Latest Grid Management Data**

   - **Objective:**
      - To ensure that the schedule generation considers the latest grid management data from both WBES and REMC.

   - **Steps:**
      a. Initiate the schedule generation process for a specific contract.
      b. Verify that the system considers the latest grid management data from both WBES and REMC.
      c. Confirm that the generated schedule aligns with the grid management requirements.

   - **Expected Result:**
      a. The schedule generation process is initiated successfully.
      b. The system considers the latest grid management data from both WBES and REMC.
      c. The generated schedule aligns with the grid management requirements.

5. **Test Case: Timestamp Validation for Schedule Generation**

   - **Objective:**
      - To verify that the system uses the last updated timestamp for schedule generation.

   - **Steps:**
      a. Update the grid management data in both WBES and REMC.
      b. Initiate the schedule generation process for a specific contract.
      c. Verify that the system uses the latest timestamp for schedule generation.

   - **Expected Result:**
      a. Grid management data is successfully updated in both WBES and REMC.
      b. The schedule generation process is initiated successfully.
      c. The system uses the latest timestamp for schedule generation.

6. **Test Case: Integration with Open Access Regulation and Guidelines**

   - **Objective:**
      - To ensure that the Grid Management Module integrates seamlessly with Open Access regulation and guidelines.

   - **Steps:**
      a. Access the Open Access regulation and guidelines section.
      b. Verify that the grid management module aligns with the specified regulations.
      c. Confirm that schedule management is in accordance with Open Access guidelines.

   - **Expected Result:**
      a. The Open Access regulation and guidelines section is accessible.
      b. The grid management module aligns with the specified regulations.
      c. Schedule management is in accordance with Open Access guidelines.
