6.6.4 Availability Assessment, Station wise Pricing and Optimization:
The Contractor shall make an assessment of the availability of various power plants within
the state/ outside the state, from where KSEBL may have contracts and from various other
sources KSEBL might have contracted. Such assessment shall consider maintenance
schedules and probabilities of forced outages. The Contractor shall also be able to highlight
the key reasons for deviation from schedule such as technical / operational reasons that
result in sudden demand loss, sudden generation loss, change in load profile due to change
in weather. The inputs from LGB, Inflow forecast, storage management, present storage,
historical analysis, spill threat etc shall also be considered in the Optimisation and
scheduling processes.
The Software shall be capable of considering any number of contracts for Power
Procurement and Internal generators. Also, software shall be capable of arriving at the
optimized cost of power to be scheduled after assessing the right mix of power sources
available. Any replacement of low-cost power from the market shall be assessed, including
platforms like MBED (Market based Economic Dispatch)/ Ancillary markets.
The above demand forecasting solutions must be based upon latest approaches used in
Power Sector and using latest state of AI/ML technologyavailable.
KSEBLâ€™s endeavour is to have a comprehensive model for the energy/ load management
and its cost optimization. Optimisation aims at automated Least-Cost scalable and errorfree scheduling, aimed at day-ahead and real-time horizon.
The suggested model shall be able to provide the following benefits to KSEBL: -
1. Minimization of operational risk/manual intervention in power procurement/sale process.
2. Improvement in productivity through an efficient and automated process implementation.
3. Efficient and accurate decision making.
The scope of work defined above, is only indicative and not limited to the above. Any
further requirement to achieve the final objective of energy/ load management and cost
optimization shall also form part of the scope of work.
